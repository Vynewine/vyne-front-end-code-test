Vyne Frontend Code Test
==============================

Overview
--------

This test is intended to provide an opportunity for you, an engineering applicant, to demonstrate your software engineering knowledge.

The logic you employ and the approach you take to solve the problem are the most interesting to us. Each of the given problems have at least a handful of valid solutions, and possibly other solutions we’ve never seen. So, donʼt worry about finding "the" solution. Provide a solution that you like. 

You can use any 3rd party plugins or frameworks to accomplish this exercise. You can use any IDE or code editor you choose, any browser and testing framework for testing your code, and it's okay to use Google search for help.

Please review the exercises first. If anything is unclear or confusing, please contact us and we will help clarify any issues.

Most importantly, have fun! 

Getting Started
---------------
To get started you'll clone our project from GitHub found at [https://github.com/Vynewine/vyne-front-end-code-test](https://github.com/Vynewine/vyne-front-end-code-test "Frontent Code Test Repo at GitHub").

Commit each exercise when you're done with it.

Exercise #1
-----------
Create an **HTML5** page with header, footer and main sections in index.html. The main section should contain a content section and a sidebar. Set the width of the sidebar section to 300 pixels. Make the sidebar float to the right side of the content section.

The header section should contain a nav with three links:

- Home ( index.html )
- About ( /about )
- Blog ( /blog )

    A man walking his two lap dogs off-leash in an area that had been off-leash for years until December ended up at the wrong end...

Exercise #3
